This past weekend, [Benjy](https://twitter.com/benjyfishy) not only qualified for FNCS Grand Finals, but got [1st EU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPArs87NMVE) in the process. [Joe](https://twitter.com/_joefn) and [Shadow](https://twitter.com/Shadowwfn_) are amazing teammates and their chemistry has been \*chef's kiss\*. I'm so happy to see Benjy playing well. So happy. I want nothing more than to see him win Grands.
