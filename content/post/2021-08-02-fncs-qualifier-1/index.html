<p>This past weekend, <a href="https://twitter.com/benjyfishy">Benjy</a> not only qualified for FNCS Grand Finals, but got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPArs87NMVE">1st EU</a> in the process. <a href="https://twitter.com/_joefn">Joe</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Shadowwfn_">Shadow</a> are amazing teammates and their chemistry has been *chef’s kiss*. I’m so happy to see Benjy playing well. So happy. I want nothing more than to see him win Grands.</p>
